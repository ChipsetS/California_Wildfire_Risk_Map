California is plagued by wildfires all year round. The fires in the fall of this year even spread smoke and fire to several neighboring states in California. When I opened the window and saw that the sky in Arizona became hazy, I was thinking about whether we can use data analysis to predict and prevent wildfires in California. 

After determining this topic, in order to predict and prevent wildfires in California, I think the best way is to subdivide California and analyze the wildfires that have occurred this year. Because the management of fire sites needs to be allocated to local governments, I decided to subdivide California into each county. The analysis of fire risk after detailed to the county will help the management of the local government. It also makes it possible to formulate a suitable management plan according to local conditions.

The primary data set I found from Kaggle contains information about most of the wildfires that have been confirmed since 2013.
